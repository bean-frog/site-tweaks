# how to use schoology+ unblocked
#### the admins decided to be goofy and blocked schoology+ but they only blocked that specific extension and not any of the actual functions 
#### download the zip file and unzip it then go to extensions menu in chrome, brave, opera, whatever and select developer options
#### press load unpacked and select the unzipped folder
#### schoology plus should now work
#### if it doesnt for you either try again or add a discussion topic with whatever features you wanted and ill make a standalone version
